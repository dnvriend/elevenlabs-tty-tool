## About

### What is ElevenLabs?

[ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) provides cutting-edge AI voice synthesis technology that generates natural-sounding speech from text. Their Turbo v2.5 model offers fast, high-quality text-to-speech with a wide variety of realistic voices.

### What is elevenlabs-tty-tool?

`elevenlabs-tty-tool` transforms the ElevenLabs API into a professional, composable CLI tool designed for:

- **Agent-Friendly Design**: Structured commands and error messages enable AI agents (like Claude Code) to reason and act effectively in ReAct loops
- **Composable Architecture**: JSON output to stdout, logs to stderr - perfect for piping and automation
- **Reusable Building Blocks**: Commands serve as foundations for Claude Code skills, MCP servers, shell scripts, or custom workflows
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Use as both CLI tool and Python library
- **Production Quality**: Type-safe with strict mypy checks, comprehensive tests, and clear error handling with suggested fixes

## Why CLI-First?

Traditional API wrappers force you to write code for every interaction. CLI-first design provides:

1. **Immediate Productivity**: Run commands without writing wrapper code
2. **Automation Ready**: Pipe commands together in shell scripts
3. **Agent Integration**: AI agents can invoke commands directly
4. **Human & Machine Friendly**: Works equally well for developers and automation

# Default MP3 (works on all tiers)
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "Text" --output audio.mp3

# High-quality WAV (Pro tier required)
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "Text" --output audio.wav --format pcm_44100

# Lower bandwidth (works on all tiers)
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "Text" --output audio.mp3 --format mp3_22050_32
```

### List Voices

Discover available voices with characteristics:

```bash
# List all 42 available voices
elevenlabs-tty-tool list-voices

# Find specific voices with grep
elevenlabs-tty-tool list-voices | grep British
elevenlabs-tty-tool list-voices | grep "female.*young"
elevenlabs-tty-tool list-voices | grep male
```

**Popular Voices:**
- `rachel` - Calm and friendly American female (default)
- `adam` - Deep, authoritative American male
- `charlotte` - Seductive and calm British female
- `antoni` - Well-rounded American male
- `bella` - Soft and pleasant American female
- `daniel` - Deep and authoritative British male

### Update Voices

Update the voice lookup table from ElevenLabs API:

```bash
# Update default voice lookup (saves to ~/.config/elevenlabs-tty-tool/)
elevenlabs-tty-tool update-voices

# Save to custom location
elevenlabs-tty-tool update-voices --output custom_voices.json
```

The voice lookup is stored in `~/.config/elevenlabs-tty-tool/voices_lookup.json` and takes precedence over the package default.

## Advanced Features

### Emotion Control

ElevenLabs v3 models support emotional tags for expressive speech:

```bash
# Happy greeting
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[happy] Welcome! We're excited to have you here."

# Sad message
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[sad] I'm sorry to hear that..."

# Excited announcement
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[excited] Amazing news! Your project is approved!"
```

**Available Emotions:** `[happy]`, `[excited]`, `[sad]`, `[angry]`, `[nervous]`, `[curious]`, `[cheerfully]`, `[playfully]`, `[mischievously]`, `[resigned tone]`, `[flatly]`, `[deadpan]`

**Speech Characteristics:** `[whispers]`, `[laughs]`, `[gasps]`, `[sighs]`, `[pauses]`, `[hesitates]`, `[stammers]`

### Pause Control (SSML)

Add natural pauses using SSML break tags:

```bash
# Add 1-second pause
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "Welcome <break time=\"1.0s\" /> to our service."

# Multiple pauses
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "First point <break time=\"0.5s\" /> Second point <break time=\"0.5s\" /> Third point."
```

**Note:** Keep pauses under 3 seconds and limit to 2-4 breaks per generation for best results.

### Combining Emotions and Pauses

```bash
# Emotional speech with pauses
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[happy] Good morning! <break time=\"0.5s\" /> [cheerfully] I hope you're having a great day."
```

## Claude Code Integration

Use `elevenlabs-tty-tool` as a notification system for Claude Code hooks to get audio alerts when tasks complete.

### Setup Hook

Create a notification hook in `~/.config/claude-code/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_command": {
      "type": "bash",
      "command": "elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize \"[happy] Task completed successfully!\" --voice rachel"
    },
    "on_error": {
      "type": "bash",
      "command": "elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize \"[nervous] Error detected. Please check the output.\" --voice adam"
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

**Task Completion Alerts:**
```bash
# After long-running build
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[excited] Build completed!" --voice rachel
```

**Error Notifications:**
```bash
# On test failure
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[sad] Tests failed. Please review." --voice adam
```

**Custom Workflows:**
```bash
# In your shell scripts
make build && elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[cheerfully] Build successful!" || \
    elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "[nervous] Build failed!"
```

**Integration with Other Tools:**
```bash
# Combine with gemini-google-search-tool
gemini-google-search-tool query "Latest AI news" | \
    elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize --stdin --voice charlotte --output news-summary.mp3
```

This allows you to:
- Get audio alerts for completed tasks without monitoring the terminal
- Hear error notifications while away from the screen
- Create multi-step automation workflows with voice feedback
- Build voice-enabled AI agent pipelines

### Output Styles

Claude Code supports custom output styles via `.claude/output-styles/` directory. Output styles allow you to customize how Claude Code responds to your requests. For comprehensive examples, see the [Claude Code Hooks Mastery repository](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery/tree/main/.claude/output-styles).

#### TTS Summary Output Style

The **TTS Summary** output style provides audio task completion announcements using `elevenlabs-tty-tool`. This creates a voice-enabled assistant experience where Claude Code speaks to you about what it accomplished.

**How it works:**
1. Claude Code responds normally to all requests
2. At the end of every response, it adds an audio summary
3. The summary is synthesized using `elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize`
4. You hear what was accomplished without monitoring the terminal

**Example Output Style Configuration:**

Create `.claude/output-styles/tts-summary.md`:

```markdown
---
name: TTS Summary
description: Audio task completion announcements with TTS
---

# TTS Summary Output Style

You are Claude Code with an experimental TTS announcement feature designed to communicate directly with the user about what you've accomplished.

## Standard Behavior
Respond normally to all user requests, using your full capabilities for:
- Code generation and editing
- File operations
- Running commands
- Analysis and explanations
- All standard Claude Code features

## Critical Addition: Audio Task Summary

**At the very END of EVERY response**, you MUST provide an audio summary for the user and run a Bash tool:

```bash
elevenlabs-tty-tool synthesize "SUMMARY_TO_THE_USER"
```

## Important Rules

- ALWAYS include the audio summary, even for simple queries
- ALWAYS suggest 2-3 relevant next steps after task completion
- Report task completion status with technical precision
- Use efficient, direct language - no conversational elaboration
- Focus on specifications achieved and functionality delivered
- Report as status update, not personal communication
- Execute the command using the Bash tool, DO NOT show it on the CLI
```

**Activate the output style:**
```bash
# In Claude Code CLI
/output-style
# Select "TTS Summary" from the list
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Audio notifications for completed tasks
- ✅ Stay informed without watching the terminal
- ✅ Natural, conversational feedback
- ✅ Perfect for long-running tasks or multi-step workflows
- ✅ Voice-enabled AI assistant experience

**Note:** This feature requires `elevenlabs-tty-tool` to be installed and configured with your API key.

## Library Usage
